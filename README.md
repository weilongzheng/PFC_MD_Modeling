# Recurrent Neural Networks of Mediodorsal Thalamus and Prefrontal Cortex in Temporal Contexts

## Model Framework
We develop recurrent neural networks with a thalamus-like component and synaptic plasticity rules to model the thalamocortical interactions in cognitive flexibility. We find that the MD component is able to extract context information by integrating context-relevant traces over trials and to suppress context-irrelevant neurons in PFC. Incorporating the MD disjoints the contextual representations and enables efficient population coding in the PFC
